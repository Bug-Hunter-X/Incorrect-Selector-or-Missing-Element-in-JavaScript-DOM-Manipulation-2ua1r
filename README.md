This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving JavaScript's interaction with the DOM.  The bug arises from attempting to manipulate a DOM element using a selector that either doesn't match any existing element or targets an element that's dynamically created after the script has executed. This can result in the script failing without throwing errors, or in unexpected behavior. The solution showcases how to address this using robust error handling and ensuring proper timing of DOM manipulation.
